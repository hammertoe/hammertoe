# Matt Hamilton

*Python, AI/ML, Blockchain, XRP Ledger Developer Advocate*

Hi! I'm Matt, a developer and developer advocate interested in the XRP Ledger, blockchains and cryptocurrencies in general, AI / machine learning, and Python.

As a developer, I enjoy building things, especially combining multiple different things, to produce something new.

As a developer advocate, I enjoy helping other developers to learn, understand and build. Let's learn something new together! I am also the "voice of the developer" at the table â€” bringing your feedback to the product team.
